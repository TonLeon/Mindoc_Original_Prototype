# About Sourcelab

SourceLab is a student-run initiative that produces high-quality, digitally accessible editions of historical sources in the public domain.  We provide these editions to the public, free of charge.
SourceLab was started by students, staff, and faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in the Spring of 2015.
You can find more information about SourceLab [here](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/sourcelab_idea/index).
